# Steam Library Explorer

`Steam Library Explorer` is similar to the [SteamTool Library Manager](http://www.stefanjones.ca/steam/) with full support for `Steam Library` folders.

`Steam Library Explorer` shows the list of games locally installed in`Steam` and lets you move games (and their workshop content between libraries.

**Important: MSI AfterBurner makes SteamLibraryExplorer crash at startup**.
> To workaround the issue, add "SteamLibraryExplorer.exe" to the list of known applications of [Rivatuner Statistics Server](http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) and disable OSD for the application, i.e. set `Application Detection Level` to `None`.

*Note:* This application is not affiliated with Valve and/or Steam.
